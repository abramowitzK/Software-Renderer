To build and run:
make ARGS="your args here" run

make clean to clean
make build to build

This program, given a postscript file containing lines, will output an xpm file to stdout containing the clipped and transformed lines (controlled by
user input).
This program will now also allow polygons to be entered by using moveto, lineto and stroke. It can also perform transformations and clipping on these.
Language : C#
Developed on windows for .NET 4. Runs on Linux with Mono v3.x 

File containing main: Driver.cs

This mostly works but my U and V stuff doesn't seem to be working well and there are issues with clipping(it won't crash though). I feel like it's something
simple but I have spent so much time trying to figure it out and haven't really gotten anywhere so I guess i'll ask in class. It draws most of the pictures
correctly it seems.

I tried to comment anything that might be confusing if you haven't used C# before. This is running on the Mono runtime on tux but it will
also run on .NET 4 or greater on windows just fine. There's an sln file if you want to open this with visual studio on windows.
