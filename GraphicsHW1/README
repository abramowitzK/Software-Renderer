This program, given a postscript file containing lines, will output an xpm file to stdout containing the clipped and transformed lines (controlled by
user input).
This program will now also allow polygons to be entered by using moveto, lineto and stroke. It can also perform transformations and clipping on these.
Language : C#
Developed on windows for .NET 4. Runs on Linux with Mono v3.x 

File containing main: Driver.cs

I ran through all the test cases given in the assignment and the outputs look good
finally. I tried to comment anything that might be confusing if you haven't used C# before. This is running on the Mono runtime on tux but it will
also run on .NET 4 or greater on windows just fine. There's an sln file if you want to open this with visual studio on windows.
