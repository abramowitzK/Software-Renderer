I haven't implemented the transformations using homogenous coordinates yet but they will be implemented next assignment. I ran into a lot of wierd
little bugs that needed to be fixed and it took a alot of time. I ran through all the test cases given in the assignment and the outputs look good
finally. I tried to comment anything that might be confusing if you haven't used C# before. This is running on the Mono runtime on tux but it will
also run on .NET 4 or greater on windows just fine. There's an sln file if you want to open this with visual studio on windows.
