To build and run:
make ARGS="your args here" run

make clean to clean
make build to build

This program, given a postscript file containing lines, will output an xpm file to stdout containing the clipped and transformed lines (controlled by
user input).

Language : C#
Developed on windows for .NET 4. Runs on Linux with Mono v3.x 

File containing main: Driver.cs

I haven't implemented the transformations using homogenous coordinates yet but they will be implemented next assignment. I ran into a lot of wierd
little bugs that needed to be fixed and it took a alot of time. I ran through all the test cases given in the assignment and the outputs look good
finally. I tried to comment anything that might be confusing if you haven't used C# before. This is running on the Mono runtime on tux but it will
also run on .NET 4 or greater on windows just fine. There's an sln file if you want to open this with visual studio on windows.
