# Software-Renderer
Software renderer I made as a class assignment. Outputs images to xpm. Not feature complete but I may update it if I have time. It's a little messy but it can draw 3d meshes mostly well

Currently draws a filled polygon without depth cueing or any zbuffering. This is slightly sub awesome so I should fix that at some point.
All meshes are included and it should draw something reasonable with the default arguments.
